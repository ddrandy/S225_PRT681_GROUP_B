C2 – 20 Common Basic Tech Q&A (Entry-Level Tester)
Testing Fundamentals
1.	What is the difference between verification and validation?
Verification checks whether the product is built correctly (meets design/spec).
Validation checks whether the right product is built (meets user needs).
2.	What are functional vs non-functional testing? Give examples.
Functional: tests what the system does (e.g. login works).
Non-functional: tests how the system performs (e.g. speed, security, usability).
3.	What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?
STLC covers phases like requirement analysis, test planning, test case design, test execution, defect reporting, and closure.
4.	Explain smoke vs regression testing.
Smoke: quick check to confirm build stability.
Regression: ensures existing features still work after changes.
5.	Difference between manual and automation testing?
Manual: tests done by humans step-by-step.
Automation: scripts/tools run tests repeatedly.
6.	What are positive test cases vs negative test cases?
Positive: valid inputs to confirm system works.
Negative: invalid inputs to check system handles errors gracefully.

Defects & Bug Tracking
7.	What is a defect/bug, and how is it different from error and failure?
Bug/defect: mismatch between expected and actual results.
Error: human mistake in code/design.
Failure: system doesn’t perform expected function.
8.	Explain defect life cycle.
New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Closed (or Reopen if issue persists).
9.	What key details should you include in a bug report?
Title, environment, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual result, severity, attachments/screenshots.

Test Design & Execution
10.	What is a test case? Components?
A test case defines input, action, and expected result.
Components: ID, description, preconditions, steps, expected/actual results, status.
11.	Difference between test plan and test strategy?
Test plan: project-specific, details scope, schedule, resources.
Test strategy: high-level approach for organisation (overall methodology).
12.	What is boundary value analysis? Example?
Tests edge values at input boundaries.
Example: age field (18–60) → test 17, 18, 60, 61.
13.	What is equivalence partitioning?
Divides inputs into valid/invalid groups.
Example: password length (6–12) → <6, 6–12, >12.

Agile & Collaboration
14.	What role does QA play in Agile methodology?
QA works closely with devs and BAs throughout sprints, writing test cases early, testing stories, and giving quick feedback.
15.	What happens in a daily stand-up?
Team shares yesterday’s work, today’s plan, and blockers.
Quick sync, not a detailed meeting.

Tools & Basics
16.	What is JIRA used for in testing?
JIRA is used for managing tasks, user stories, test cases, and defect tracking in Agile projects.
17.	What is API testing, and why is it important?
API testing validates data exchange between systems.
Ensures backend works correctly before UI is built.
18.	What is SQL, and why do testers need to know it?
SQL is used to query databases.
Testers need it to check data accuracy and backend validation.
19.	What is Selenium, and how does it help in testing?
Selenium is an open-source automation tool for web apps.
It helps automate repetitive browser tests.
20.	Why is version control (like Git) useful for testers?
Git tracks changes to test scripts and documents.
Helps collaborate safely with developers and QA team.

C2: 20 Resume/Project-specific Technical Q&A (Entry-Level Tester)
 
JIRA / Test Management
1. Can you explain how you created and managed a test case in JIRA/Zephyr?
Context: In my practice project, I set up Zephyr inside JIRA.
Action: I created a test case with steps, expected results, and linked it to a user story.
Result: It gave me hands-on understanding of managing test cases in Agile tools.
2. What’s the difference between an epic, story, task, and bug in JIRA?
Epic = large feature, Story = user requirement, Task = specific work, Bug = defect found.
I practised by creating each in JIRA to see how they link together.

Bug Tracking
3. How do you log a bug in Bugzilla? What key fields should you always fill in?
Context: In my Bugzilla exercise, I logged a sample login issue.
Action: I filled in title, environment, severity, steps to reproduce, and attachments.
Result: It showed me the importance of clear bug reports for devs.
4. Can you explain the life cycle of a bug/defect from discovery to closure?
New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Closed (or Reopen).
I practised this flow in Bugzilla to understand transitions.

API Testing (Postman)
5. What is an API, and why do testers need to test APIs?
APIs allow systems to talk to each other.
Testers validate data exchange before UI is ready, saving time and catching backend issues early.
6. Show me an example of a GET and POST request you ran in Postman.
Context: I tested a public “users” API.
Action: I sent a GET to fetch users and a POST to add a dummy record.
Result: I verified status codes (200/201) and checked response body.
7. How would you verify the response of an API call in Postman?
Context: While testing a sample API.
Action: I checked status code, response time, and body fields using Postman’s test tab.
Result: This confirmed the API worked as expected.

Automation Tools (Selenium / Cypress)
8. How did you create your first Selenium script?
Context: I practised automating Google search.
Action: Wrote a simple Java Selenium script to open browser, enter text, and click search.
Result: It gave me confidence in writing automation basics.
9. What’s the difference between Selenium and Cypress?
Selenium: works across browsers/languages, more flexible.
Cypress: faster setup, focused on modern JS apps.
I tried both to see pros/cons for small projects.
10. In your Selenium/Cypress project, what challenges did you face?
Context: Setting up Selenium with drivers was tricky.
Action: I followed tutorials, fixed PATH issues, and used simple examples.
Result: Once configured, I could run tests smoothly.

 SQL / Database Testing
11. Write a SQL query to find all users older than 30.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
•	Simple query I practised in MySQL sandbox.
12. Why is SQL knowledge important for a tester?
•	Testers validate backend data, check CRUD operations, and confirm system consistency.
•	Knowing SQL means we don’t rely only on UI.
13. Can you explain how you tested data consistency using SQL queries?
Context: I had a mock e-commerce DB.
Action: I ran queries to check order details matched user IDs across tables.
Result: It helped me understand cross-table validation.

 Version Control (Git/GitHub)
14. How did you use GitHub in your projects?
Context: I used GitHub to store my practice test scripts.
Action: I created a repo, committed changes, and pushed updates.
Result: It gave me version history and collaboration practice.
15. Why is version control important for testers?
•	Test scripts and docs change often.
•	Git helps track changes, rollback safely, and collaborate with dev teams.

CI/CD Awareness (Jenkins)
16. What is Continuous Integration and why is it important for QA?
•	CI integrates code frequently into a shared repo.
•	QA benefits by testing earlier builds and catching defects faster.
17. Can you describe a simple Jenkins pipeline you studied or ran?
Context: I explored Jenkins basics.
Action: Created a freestyle job to pull from GitHub and run a sample test.
Result: I understood how automation fits into CI/CD pipelines.

Agile / Scrum
18. What role does a tester play in Agile ceremonies?
Testers join sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retros.
Action: I practised by writing test cases alongside user stories.
Result: This showed how QA contributes continuously, not at the end.
19. Can you explain the difference between regression testing and smoke testing?
Smoke = quick check of major functions.
Regression = detailed re-check of existing features after changes.

Cloud Awareness
20. Why do testers need to be aware of cloud platforms like AWS or Azure? Can you give an example?
Apps are often hosted on cloud.
Example: A tester may check if an app runs correctly across AWS environments (e.g., S3 storage, EC2 instances).
Awareness helps align testing with deployment setups
