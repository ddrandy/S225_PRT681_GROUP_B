Start JMeter

Run bin/jmeter (GUI) or bin/jmeter.bat on Windows.

Create Test Plan

Right-click Test Plan → Add → Threads (Users) → Thread Group.

Configure: Number of Threads (users), Ramp-Up (seconds), Loop Count (or check Forever).

Set target server defaults (optional but handy)

Right-click Thread Group → Add → Config Element → HTTP Request Defaults.

Set Server Name or IP (e.g. example.com) and Port Number (e.g. 80 or 443).

Add HTTP Sampler (the request)

Right-click Thread Group → Add → Sampler → HTTP Request.

Method: GET/POST. Path: /api/login (example). If using JSON, leave Body Data for payload.

Add CSV Data Set Config (for parameterized tests like multiple users)

Right-click Thread Group → Add → Config Element → CSV Data Set Config.

Set Filename, Variable Names (e.g. username,password), Recycle on EOF = True/False as needed.

Add HTTP Header Manager (for JSON content type, auth tokens)

Right-click HTTP Request or Thread Group → Add → Config Element → HTTP Header Manager.

Add Content-Type: application/json, Authorization: Bearer ${token}, etc.

Add Timers (to avoid unrealistic instant requests)

Right-click Thread Group → Add → Timer → Constant Timer or Uniform Random Timer.

Set delay (ms) between requests.

Add Assertions (validate responses)

Right-click HTTP Request → Add → Assertion → Response Assertion.

E.g., assert that Response Code equals 200 or Response Text contains success.

Add Listeners (view results) — use sparingly in GUI for large loads

Right-click Thread Group → Add → Listener → View Results in Table / Summary Report / Aggregate Report / View Results Tree.

Tip: Remove heavy listeners (View Results Tree) for large tests; they consume memory.
